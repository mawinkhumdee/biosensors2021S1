<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The World Health Organization accepts several methods of screening for COVID-19, including Realtime RT-PCR and the Antigen test. Many more screening options are being researched and developed by many researchers. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of them because COVID-19 is an infectious disease of the lower respiratory tract that can affect the cardiovascular system and cause irregular heartbeats. And the results of an experiment to take electrocardiogram images of patients and healthy people using convolutional neural networks for screening to isolate infected patients with an accuracy of 97.33 percent.
